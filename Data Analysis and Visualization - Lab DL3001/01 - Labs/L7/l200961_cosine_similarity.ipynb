Eurotunnel would not pay interest on these notes (which would constitute a debt issue) for ten years.\\nAnalysts said that under the deal, Eurotunnel\\'s ability to finance its debt would become sustainable, at least for a few years.\\n\"If you look at the current cash flow of between 150 and 200 million pounds a year, what they can\\'t find (to meet the bill) they will roll forward into the stabilisation notes, and they can keep that going for seven, eight, nine years,\" said an analyst at one major investment bank.\\n\"So they are here for that time,\" he added.\\nThe company said in a statement there was still considerable work to be done to finalise and agree the details of the plan before it can be submitted to shareholders and the bank group for approval, probably early in the Spring of 1997.\\nEurotunnel said the debt-for-equity swap would be at 130 pence, or 10.40 francs, per share -- considerably below the level of 160 pence widely reported in the run up to the deal\\nThe company said a further 3.7 billion pounds of debt would be converted into new financial instruments and existing shareholders would be able to participate in this issue.\\nIf they choose not to take up free warrants entitling them to subscribe to this, Eurotunnel said shareholders\\' interests may be reduced further to just over 39 percent of the company by the end of December 2003.\\nEurotunnel\\'s shares, which were suspended last week at 113.5 pence ahead of Monday\\'s announcement, will resume trading on Tuesday.\\nShareholders and all 225 creditor banks have to agree the deal. \"I\\'m hopeful but I\\'m not taking it (approval) for granted,\" Morton admitted, \"Shareholders are pretty angry in France.\"\\nAsked what would happen if the banks reject the deal, Morton said, \"Nobody wants a collapse, nobody wants a doomsday scenario.\"\\n($1=.6393 Pound)\\n', '/content/inputData/f2.txt': 'Anglo-French Channel Tunnel operator Eurotunnel Monday announced a deal giving its creditor banks 45.5 percent of the company in return for wiping out one billion pounds ($1.56 billion) of its debt.\\nThe long-awaited restructuring brings to an end months of wrangling between Eurotunnel and the 225 banks to which it owes nearly nine billion pounds ($14.1 billion).\\nThe deal, announced simultaneously in Paris and London, brings the company back from the brink of insolvency but leaves shareholders owning only 54.5 percent of the company.\\n\"The restructuring plan provides Eurotunnel with the medium-term financial stability to allow it to consolidate its substantial commercial achievements to date and to develop its operations,\" Eurotunnel co-chairman Alastair Morton said.\\nThe firm was now making a profit before interest, he added.\\nAlthough shareholders will see their interests diluted, they were offered the prospect of a brighter future after months of uncertainty while Eurotunnel wrestled to reduce crippling interest payments negotiated during the tunnel\\'s construction.\\nEurotunnel, which has taken around half the cross-Channel market from the European ferry companies, said a strong operating performance could allow it to pay its first dividend within the next 10 years.\\nFrench co-chairman Patrick Ponsolle said shareholders would have to be patient before they could reap the benefits of the company\\'s success.\\nHe called the debt restructuring plan \"an acceptable compromise\" for holders of Eurotunnel shares.\\nThe company said there was still considerable work to be done to finalise and agree on the details of the plan before it can be submitted to shareholders and the full 225 bank syndicate for approval, probably early in 1997.\\nMonday\\'s announcement followed two weeks of highly secretive negotiations between Eurotunnel and its six leading banks.
