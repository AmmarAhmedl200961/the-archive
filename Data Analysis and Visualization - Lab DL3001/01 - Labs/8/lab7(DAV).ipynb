       " 'Eucalyptus Pulp - Final Note': \"Martin, Subsequent to my last e-mail I discovered an additional detail which may po= ssibly clarify why ENCE prefers to purchase the Chilean E. globulus species= to the Brazilian species for pulp production.  It would appear that the E.= globulus species holds up better than the various Brazilian species during= the refining process.  While most papermakers generally don't refine hardw= oods and softwoods with the same equipment, many smaller European mills are= unable to afford the capital investment of a second refiner and accordingl= y do use a single refiner for all grades.  This is particularly true of the= Italian mills.  Since hardwoods cannot withstand the rigorous refining req= uired for softwoods without losing their papermaking characteristics (opaci= ty, etc.), these papermakers need to utilize the hardwood species best suit= ed for this type of processing.  Accordingly, the globulus species (which i= s also the predominant species in the Iberian peninsula) holds up much bett= er under this type of heavy refining than any other species of eucalyptus. In any case, I hope this helps shed additional light on this issue, and, as= always, please feel free to revert with any questions you might have.  Tha= nks. Karen\",\n",

We are bringing in an outside consultant to run this session (agenda to follow). October 24th will focus on business strategy issues (see attached 10/24 agenda).  I have taken the liberty of volunteering some of you to run specific portions of the session.  We will need to manage our time carefully if we are to successfully complete the agenda. It is also important that you develop an acocunt plan for each of the accounts you are responsible for prior to 10/23 (account assignments attached, ENE Universe).  I have already asked each of the pulp originators to get with the appropriate pulp cash trader to develop these plans.  Each plan should be concise enough to fit on one page, and contain three sections - key account goals, financial and physical products targeted to achieve account goals and an activity plan.  You will be expected to present each during the meeting. Jim',\n",

Your forecast of those prices by month for the next six months. I need you to come by my desk some time today so we can spend a few minutes discussing current trends in your market.

       " 'Jeff McMahon Named CFO': \"Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company. Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works. I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform. Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.\",\n",

       " 'Important News For Our Texas Customers': 'June 8, 2001 Dear JERRY DAREN FARMER: We are delighted that you have made a smart energy choice by signing up with NewPower(tm) as part of the Texas Electric Choice Pilot Program. Tens of thousands of Texas households have joined you in taking advantage of the tremendous savings NewPower will provide you over the next two years. As your new energy supplier, we wanted to make sure that you were informed of a recent development affecting you as a participant of the pilot program. NewPower was recently notified by the Texas Public Utility Commission (PUC) that the pilot program will be phased in more slowly over the summer months. A more gradual timetable for processing switches from your local utility to energy service providers, such as NewPower, will help to ensure a seamless transition between energy suppliers for the thousands of Texans who have enrolled in the program. Click below to read the official announcement from the Texas PUC. This requires you to have Adobe Acrobat Reader: http://i2.innovyx.com/newpower/pilot_ltr.pdf If you do not have Adobe Acrobat Reader, please click below and follow instructions for free download: http://tr.innovyx.com/redir.asp?148_46_2788 What does this mean for you? It simply means that your NewPower service will begin during July instead of June as originally planned. Until then, your existing provider will continue to provide your electricity, uninterrupted. Rest assured, once your NewPower service begins, you\\'ll still get the same great rates and excellent customer service you were promised when you signed up. There is no need for you to take any action.  NewPower expects that the Texas Public Utility Commission will enable us to begin providing your household with electric service after July 6th. In the meantime, NewPower will send a welcome letter notifying you of the effective date of your NewPower service.  If you have any questions or concerns, please visit the Public Utility Commission\\'s website at http://tr.innovyx.com/redir.asp?148_47_2788 or call NewPower at 877-819-9817.

       " 'Enron/Dynegy Merger; Antitrust Issues': \"As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing. Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement. In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals. If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).
