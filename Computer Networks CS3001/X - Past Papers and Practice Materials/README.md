# Practice Materials for Computer Networks (CN) Course

Welcome to the **Practice Materials** folder for the Computer Networks course! This collection includes a variety of tutorials, practice questions, and interactive exercises sourced from online resources and the course textbook. These materials were used to reinforce key concepts like subnetting, network addressing, and more.

I've organized the resources below for easy access. Feel free to explore and practice!

## Subnetting Practice

- **Tutorial from Ali Khwaja**: A comprehensive review session video covering subnetting fundamentals.
  - [Midterm 2 Fall 2024 - Review Session - Networking.mp4](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P35Ilm1uOvNxM_Vii8Lq0crRBLNc8zaL/view?usp=drivesdk)

- **Supporting Reference**: Quick lookup for network address spaces and subnetting techniques using memoization.
  - [Network Address Spaces and Subnetting.txt](Network Address Spaces and Subnetting.txt)

## Textbook Exercises

- Practice the end-of-chapter exercises from the book (e.g., *Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach* by Kurose & Ross).
- Verify your solutions using the provided answer keys.
- **Tip**: Focus on chapters related to network layer (e.g., IP addressing, subnetting) for the most relevant practice.

## Interactive Exercises

For hands-on learning, dive into the official interactive tools on the book's companion website:
- [Interactive Exercises](https://gaia.cs.umass.edu/kurose_ross/interactive/)

These applets cover topics like error detection, reliable data transfer, and routing algorithms. They're great for visualizing network protocols!
