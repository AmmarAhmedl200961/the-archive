You are required to conduct an in-depth macro-environment analysis of the Product/ Brand that you have chosen to work on as your course project. This is a group assignment, and will be treated as part of your term project.

Objective of this part of "Market Opportunity Analysis" is to identify the opportunities and threats that are being created for our business as a result of any major or minor changes, or expected changes, in any of the macro-environment factors. Please note that all elements of macro-environment might not be at play in any given industry. Only those that are relevant are to be identified, and their positive or  negative impacts are to be studied.
    
The facts and figures used to build your arguments must be supported with references from authentic sources. No "ifs" and "buts" please.
