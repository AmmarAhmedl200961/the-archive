    "The main purpose of EDA is to help look at data before making any assumptions. It can help\n",
    "identify obvious errors, as well as better understand patterns within the data, detect outliers or\n",
    "anomalous events, find interesting relations among the variables. Data scientists can use\n",
    "exploratory analysis to ensure the results they produce are valid and applicable to any desired\n",
    "business outcomes and goals.\n",
    "EDA also helps stakeholders by confirming they are asking the right questions. EDA can help\n",
    "answer questions about standard deviations, categorical variables, and confidence intervals. Once\n",
    "EDA is complete and insights are drawn, its features can then be used for more sophisticated data\n",
    "analysis or modeling, including machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6.2 Properties of Attributes in a dataset\n",
    "## 6.2.1 Missing Values\n",
    "Some entries can be missing because of the following reasons:\n",
    "### 1. Data Extraction:\n",
    " It is possible that there are problems with extraction process. In such\n",
    "cases, we should double-check for correct data with data guardians. Errors at data\n",
    "extraction stage are typically easy to find and can be corrected easily as well.\n",
    "### 2. Data collection: \n",
    "These errors occur at time of data collection and are harder to correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6.2.2 Outliers\n",
    "Outlier is an observation that appears far away and diverges from an overall pattern in a\n",
    "sample.Let’s take an example, we do customer profiling and find out that the average annual\n",
    "income of customers is $1 lakh. But, there are two customers having annual income of $4 and\n",
    "$4.2 million. These two customers annual income is much higher than rest of the population.\n",
    "These two observations will be seen as Outliers.\n",
    "Outliers can be due to the following reasons:\n",
    "## 1. Data Entry Errors: \n",
    "Human errors such as errors caused during data collection,\n",
    "recording, or entry can cause outliers in data. For example: Annual income of a customer\n",
    "is $100,000. Accidentally, the data entry operator puts an additional zero in the figure.\n",
    "Now the income becomes $1,000,000 which is 10 times higher. Evidently, this will be\n",
    "the outlier value when compared with rest of the population.\n",
    "## 2. Measurement Error: \n",
    "It is the most common source of outliers. This is caused when the\n",
    "measurement instrument used turns out to be faulty. For example: There are 10 weighing\n",
    "machines. 9 of them are correct, 1 is faulty. Weight measured by people on the faulty\n",
    "machine will be higher / lower than the rest of people in the group. The weights measured\n",
    "on faulty machine can lead to outliers.\n",
    "## 3. Experimental Error: \n",
    "Another cause of outliers is experimental error. For example: In a\n",
    "100m sprint of 7 runners, one runner missed out on concentrating on the ‘Go’ call which\n",
    "caused him to start late. Hence, this caused the runner’s run time to be more than other\n",
    "runners. His total run time can be an outlier.\n",
    "## 4. Data Processing Error: \n",
    "Whenever we perform data mining, we extract data from\n",
    "multiple sources. It is possible that some manipulation or extraction errors may lead to\n",
    "outliers in the dataset.\n",
    "## 5. Sampling error: \n",
    "For instance, we have to measure the height of athletes. By mistake, we\n",
    "include a few basketball players in the sample. This inclusion is likely to cause outliers in\n",
    "the dataset.\n",
