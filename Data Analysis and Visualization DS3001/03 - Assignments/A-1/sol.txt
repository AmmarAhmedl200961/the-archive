Q1.(Detecting and Handling Outliers)
You are given the following dataset of employee performance scores:

Employee_lD	Age	Experience (Years)	Salary (in $)	Performance Score
1	25	2	40000	75
2	30	5	55000	80
3	35	8	60000	85
4	40	10	120000	90
5	45	20	130000	95
6	50	25	200000	70
7	28	3	45000	82
8	60	30	300000	60
9	55	27	250000	78
10	32	7	85000	88

a. Identify outliers in the Salary column using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method. (4 Marks)

IQR = Q3 - Q1
Q1 = 1st quartile
Q3 = 3rd quartile
Outliers = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR or Q3 + 1.5 * IQR

- Salaries in ascending order: array([ 40000,  45000,  55000,  60000,  85000, 120000, 130000, 200000,
       250000, 300000])
- Q1, Q3 = (55000, 200000)
- IQR = 200000 - 55000 = 145000
- Upper bound = 200000 + 1.5 * 145000 = 417500.0, Lower bound = 55000 - 1.5 * 145000 = -162500.0

b. List the outliers you identified in the Salary column. (1 Marks)
- Outliers: None, as all salaries are within the bounds.
c. Remove the outliers from the Salary column and compute the mean salary both before and after removing the outliers.(4 Marks)
Mean Salary (before removing outliers): $128,500
Mean Salary (after removing outliers): $128,500
Since no outliers were identified, the mean salary remains unchanged.

d. Discuss how removing the outliers affects the overall dataset, especially in terms of data distribution and quality.
there were no outliers in the Salary column, removing them had no impact on the dataset. However, if outliers were present and removed, the following effects would be typical:

Data Distribution: Removing extreme values would make the dataset more representative of the majority of employees, potentially reducing skewness or making the distribution more normal.
Data Quality: By removing outliers, the dataset becomes cleaner and more reliable, especially when outliers result from data entry errors or represent rare, unusual cases that may distort the overall analysis.
Central Tendency Measures: If outliers were removed, metrics like mean and standard deviation would be less influenced by extreme values, providing a more accurate reflection of the data's central tendencies.

(Data Normalization)
Given the following dataset of student scores in different subjects:
Student ID	Math	Science	English
1	80	90	85
2	75	88	92
3	89	94	76
4	90	85	88
5	82	78	80

FOR ANSWERS REfer to scratch file
a. Normalize the scores in each subject using Min-Max normalization so that the scores are between 0 and 1(3 Marks)
b. Perform Z-score normalization on the dataset.(3 Marks)
c. Normalize the marks for each subject (Math, Physics, Chemistry) using the Decimal Scaling method. (3 Marks)
