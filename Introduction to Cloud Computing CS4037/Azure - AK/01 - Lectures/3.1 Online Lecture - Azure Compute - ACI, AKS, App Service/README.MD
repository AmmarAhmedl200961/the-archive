This is the recording of the online lecture for today's (Sep 5 2024) class.

Be sure to watch videos in the links.  Especially the one under "What is Kubernetes".  Brendan Burns, Microsoft's Distinguished Engineer in Azure Compute gives high level understanding of what K8s is.  We discussed many of the points today as well.

As discussed today, you guys should have high level understanding of K8s' services running, and their purpose, k8s architecture, and its relationship to ACI.

Enjoy!
