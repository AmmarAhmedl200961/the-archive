"then 4-4 will be checked with 1 remaining" > 
if the division is 4-4-1 then it will take 2 more comparisons to find the heavier ball.
1. 4 vs 4
2. 2 vs 2
3. 1 vs 1
The correct division of 9 balls is 3-3-3

"If one side weighs heavier, then 12-12-1 is separated and 12-12 checked on balance"
it will take 3 comparisons to find the heaviest ball in 12 balls. Thus the total number of comparisons will be 5
The correct division is
50 25 8/9 3 1

"Either side found heavier (or remainder 9 heavier) will be checked 4-4-1 on balance with 1 left"
The division is 3 3 3

"can be halved"
That cannot be done. We cannot accurately measure anything by eye

"1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128 and 24 "
22 is left over
