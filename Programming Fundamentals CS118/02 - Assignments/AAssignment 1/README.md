A lot of students were having difficulty with question 7 (graphing a linear equation). So here is a hint to help you. If you have already solved the question then you can disregard this hint.





Your program only needs to print 5 different characters, '+', '-', '|', 'X', and '  ' (empty space). All your program needs to do is to decide what character to print for every position. As is obvious by the sample provided, certain characters will only be used in certain places, like 'X' will only be used for points that are on the line and '|' is only used for points on the y-axis
